        The Spy Who Loved Me is a 1977 spy film, the tenth in the James Bond
        series produced by Eon Productions. It is the third to star Roger Moore
        as the fictional secret agent James Bond. The film co-stars Barbara Bach
        and Curt Jürgens and was directed by Lewis Gilbert. The screenplay was
        by Christopher Wood and Richard Maibaum, with an uncredited rewrite by
        Tom Mankiewicz. The film takes its title from Ian Fleming's 1962 novel
        The Spy Who Loved Me, the tenth book in the James Bond series, though it
        does not contain any elements of the novel's plot. The storyline
        involves a reclusive megalomaniac named Karl Stromberg, who plans to
        destroy the world and create a new civilisation under the sea. Bond
        teams up with a Soviet agent, Anya Amasova, to stop the plans, all while
        being hunted by Stromberg’s powerful henchman, Jaws. It was shot on
        location in Egypt (Cairo and Luxor) and Italy (Costa Smeralda,
        Sardinia), with underwater scenes filmed at the Bahamas (Nassau), and a
        new soundstage built at Pinewood Studios for a massive set which
        depicted the interior of a supertanker. The Spy Who Loved Me was well
        received by critics, who saw the film as a return to form for the
        franchise and praised Moore's performance. Moore himself called the film
        his personal favourite of his tenure as Bond. The soundtrack composed by
        Marvin Hamlisch also met with success. The film was nominated for three
        Academy Awards amid many other nominations and novelised in 1977 by
        Christopher Wood as James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me.
